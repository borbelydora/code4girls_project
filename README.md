# code4girls_project
Final Project of the python course Code for Girls sponsored by Morgan Stanley 

Our objective was the generation of a code in which we could read the information from a csv file, take the sales and calculate the total

We added a module of plots usin python libraries to take a better advantage of the information from the dataset that we chose

This is a guidance for the start of our programming path

When we will see from the future to this point we will be able to see how much we had walked, change, and improved

We are girls trying to break the barriers of the computational world to open a new path full of oportunities
